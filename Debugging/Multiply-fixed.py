# Algorithm for multiplying two numbers

def multiply(x, y):
    product = 0
    for z in range(y):
        product += x
    
    return product

first = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
prod = multiply(first, second)

print(f"The product of {first}, {second} is {prod}")
